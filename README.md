### **Hello there!**  Glad you dropped by!  :bow:
I'm Santiago, an Argentinian Biomedical Engineer currently working on my master's in Artificial intelligence and a few cool projects that integrate AI&ML, Electronics, and Biotechnology. <br>

### Natural Language Processing 

* [Bag of words and why they're still relevant](https://github.com/esgoty/Elessanti/tree/main/Non-touchable%20interfaces/NLP/bags)<br> 
  The thing is... machines still think in binary and you need to help them out to understand your corpus. Additionally, as matter of fact, processing power can be a concern in some applications. Bigger is not always better nor possible (I'm looking at you GPT-3 :D )
<br>

* [Training a simple chat bot ](https://github.com/esgoty/Elessanti/tree/main/Non-touchable%20interfaces/NLP/chandler)<br> 
  Once you got some numeric representation for your corpus, you can do a number of cool things. For example extracting all the lines of your favorite 90's sitcom character and ask him things about the series!. Go and ask chandler a few things, don't be shy!
<br>

* [Obtaining context dependent vector representations ](https://github.com/esgoty/Elessanti/tree/main/Non-touchable%20interfaces/NLP/embeddings)<br> 
 Wouldn't it be great to let the machine obtain a vector representation of the words for us? Wouldn't be superb to also have a context-dependent representation instead of vectorizing/encoding a bunch of loose words? wait no more and check out the realm of representation learning and embeddings.
<br>

* [Predicting the next word with custom embeddings ](https://github.com/esgoty/Elessanti/tree/main/Non-touchable%20interfaces/NLP/RNNs)<br> 
Wouldn't be great if while you write your next great AI paper, you could additionally write it coining the content in the same way Carl Sagan would do it. Wait no more, using the great advances of Recurrent neural networks, we can train a bot to tell us what to type in... Carl sagan style! 
<br>

* [Learn about your user base using LSTMs ](https://github.com/esgoty/Elessanti/tree/main/Non-touchable%20interfaces/NLP/LSTMs)<br> 
Every e-commerce platform nowadays is heavily customer-centric. This means that any other platform will study its customers in one way or another to get to know them and to provide a better product. One such techniques, is knowing about the sentiment of customers reviewing different key products. This seemly easy task, is nearly impossible to carry out for traditional RRNs, but fear no more!
With the advert of LSTM networks, the context nuances of a typical review are highly approachable!
