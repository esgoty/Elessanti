**A bit about me:** I'm an Argentinian Biomedical Engineer currently working on my master's in Artificial intelligence. After my bachelor's, I got myself into data sciences, a field that always got my attention but seemed a bit far reached on the implementations. Nevertheless, getting to know more about this great and interesting knowledge corpus I find myself in trouble...  wanting to know a bit more every day!
