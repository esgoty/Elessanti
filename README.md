Data science applications for life sciences

## **Hello there!**

I'm Santiago, an Argentinian Biomedical Engineer currently working on my master's in Artificial intelligence. 

I'm glad you could drop by!  :bow:


<br><br>

## **About This Repository**
This repository contains a broad range of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning topics related to Life science applications. 
I've cherrypicked some starter examples on each category that I've found interesting to know a little bit more about the DataScience & Lifesciences *jumelage*.

Hope you find something interesting!

### Natural Language Processing 

* **Bag of words and why they're still relevant**<br> 
  The thing is... machines still think in binary and you need to help them understand your corpus. Additionally, as matter of fact, processing power can be a concern in some applications. Bigger is not always better nor possible (I'm looking at you GPT-3 :D )
