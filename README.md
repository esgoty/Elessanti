# Data science applications for life sciences



<br>

## **About**

**Welcome to my repository!**

This repository contains a broad range of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning topics  related to Life science applications. 

Four main directories can be found:

- **Section 1:** Cloud deployments and databases
- **Section 2:** Protein modeling and directed evolution
- **Section 3:** Non-touchable interfaces: NLP and brain-machine interfaces
- **Section 4:** Misc projects

### **Bag of words and why it's still relevant**
The thing is... machines still think in binary and you need to help them understand your corpus. Additionaly, as matter of fact, processing power can be a concern in some applications. Bigger is not always better nor possible (I'm looking at you GPT-3 :D )

### **A bit about me:** 
I'm an Argentinian Biomedical Engineer currently working on my master's in Artificial intelligence. After my bachelor's, I got myself into data sciences, a field that always got my attention but seemed a bit far reached on the implementations. Nevertheless, getting to know more about this great and interesting knowledge corpus I find myself in trouble...  wanting to know a bit more every day!
