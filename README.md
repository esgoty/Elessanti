### **Hello there!**  Glad you dropped by!  :bow:
I'm Santiago, an Argentinian Biomedical Engineer currently working on my master's in Artificial intelligence and a few cool projects that integrate AI&ML, Electronics, and Biotechnology.

### Natural Language Processing 

* **Bag of words and why they're still relevant**<br> 
  The thing is... machines still think in binary and you need to help them understand your corpus. Additionally, as matter of fact, processing power can be a concern in some applications. Bigger is not always better nor possible (I'm looking at you GPT-3 :D )

* **Chatbots**<br>
